A *bulleted* list:

An example of text with **bold** and *italic* fonts.

I am going to design an application called **NBA Player Trading Simulator**. 
This application can simulate possible trades of NBA players among different teams, 
display the changes of the teams due to trades, 
and calculate the luxury tax if the salary is above the tax line.

The administrators of each NBA team can use this application to assess their intended trades. 
In addition, NBA medias or fans who are interested in trades can use this application to simulate their desired trades.

As an NBA fan for several years, 
I always pay great attention to the trades among NBA teams. 
However, I am not able to gather sufficient information about the trades just from the news. 
Therefore, I want to design an application that allows me to view the trades from the manager's perspective.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add a player to the trading list.
- As a user, I want to be able to view all the players in the team I select.
- As a user, I want to be able to judge whether the salary is above the tax line.
- As a user, I want to be able to select a player and view this player in detail.
